<h2>A FUGUE OF HELL.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dreamed a mighty dream. It seemed mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sealed for the moment were to things terrene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then there came a strange, great wind that blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From undiscovered lands, and took my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set it on an uttermost peak of Hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the gloom and fearful silences.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the darkness paled, and a weird dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke on my wondering vision, and there grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncanny phosphorescence in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which seemed to throb with some great vital spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mystery and doom. With aching eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gazed, and lo! the dreadful scene evolved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black and chaotic, like an awful birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Desolation, of a lifeless world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul in agony cried out to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When of a sudden all the place grew calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for the trembling of the mountain peaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the low moaning of the billowy winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the abysses. Dull lights here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindled, like wreckage of a city razed<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><span class="i0">By vandals, and the inky sky cupped up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a black, impenetrable roof....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now from out the chaos there arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another sound more fearful than the wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tempest, or the quake of mighty hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal cry, a human voice in Hell!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The infernal glare grew brighter, and there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto mine ears the sound of many tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling discordant curse with bitter cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lamentation. On the outer marge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hell's domains, set one at each of four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far sundered corners, four volcanoes grim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spewed up their flaming bowels into a sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blackness whence no light could issue forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond this fierce horizon, farther yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than vision's wing could bear my gaze, I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell's desolate kingdoms stretched their iron wastes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell's burning mountains waved their brands of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell's lava rivers plunged in fury down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their adamantine beds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">The human cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepened,&mdash;the stunning babel shrieked and roared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though some mighty revolution swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flying hosts along&mdash;some pang too keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the immortal and transcendent pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hell to quench, was burning in their souls.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slowly mine eyes pierced through the pallid light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crowned the awful place, and then I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which shall not be seen of mortal eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the final day. I saw the vast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black concourse of Inferno pouring in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Hell's four sides, and gathering at the base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a stupendous mountain whose great crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towered high above the glare, and lost itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blackness. Never met such throng before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Hell or Heaven. Flowing round the mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a huge deluge, from afar they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near. A dreadful sound was on mine ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the first great call of deep to deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke on the natal silence, or as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wailing cry of universal death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall shake the pillars of eternity!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still came the multitudes, and still the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human souls surged round the iron base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that mysterious mountain, while afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dim circumference was added to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With newer legions. Conquerors of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armored and visored in resplendent steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Galloped on Hell-steeds, that with one great bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleared bottomless ca&ntilde;ons; then the kings and queens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Babylon, shorn of their lofty state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came abject, and with terror in those eyes<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span class="i0">That once outshone the world; and after them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myriads who reveled at the feast of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the reeling stupor of their wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had loosened, woke and found their souls in Hell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What horrid crisis, then, I thought, can bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infernal minions to assemble here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the shadow of this gloomy peak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seems to thrust aloft its fearful head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to God's footstool? Then as if there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer direct to my soul's questioning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great voice lifted from the throng, which seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear up heaven-high its might of words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying: "Thou wan inheritors of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels and princes, ministers of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearken! The day of all great days is come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commemorative of that legend old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose prophecy is that when the time has run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million &aelig;ons out, if God relent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A symbol shall be set upon the top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of yonder mount&mdash;a blazing star&mdash;to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hope is not yet dead. O powers of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children of woe and darkness! not again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall Hell know such a gathering as this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, if hope be not forever fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day of our redemption shall arrive!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice ceased and a murmur ran through Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fearful whisper, scarcely breathing, "Hope!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span class="i0">Then louder, as when storms begin to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gusty and fitful, and the word was "Hope!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, rising like a tempest, swelling high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vast crescendo, swept the human cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all Hell's thunderous gamut answered "<i>Hope!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The shouts ceased, and the exultation died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly into a sort of empty wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hope and half despair, for still the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not yet blazed upon their eager eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then as I sat in wondering agony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praying, yet fearing, for the greatest cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever souls of men in balance set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gainst everlasting doom, there rose again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of their great leader, Lucifer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rebel angel, and outcast of God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, hosts of Hell," he cried, "inheritors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death diurnal, strangely mingled with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relentless life, what shall we say to God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who waits and watches? Shall we pray or curse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implore or threaten? Can we move Him thus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn not the lightnings yet in His right hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which He struck us to confusion once?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughs He not in thunderbolts the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As once pursued our howling flight to Hell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befits it rather, think ye not, my hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we should send on high in one accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty threnody&mdash;a hymn of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span class="i0">Inspired by pain and sung in bitterest woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our best offering,&mdash;and await His word?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He ceased, and for the moment all was still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then plaintive as the rhythmic dawn of stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a night of sorrow, rose a strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lamentation, such as when the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes moan unto an earthquake's inward throes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then circling outward passed the rising tones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that sad minstrelsy, and then again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Backward it swept like a great tidal wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anguish, all Hell's anarchy of grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set to a sounding fugue. Grim-throated rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful hymn, and mingling with the wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of voices, pealed the cymbals' brassy clang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunderous organs bellowed through the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rocking Hell's foundations, burst a blare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stormy trumpets crying: "Woe, woe, woe!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought the angels must have wept to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought their tears had dropt like healing rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the fires of torment, and assuaged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their blazing wrath, so piteous was the strain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The music ceased, the echoes sobbed away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a tumultuous sorrow, when, behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black veil lifted from the mountain's crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on its glorious summit flamed <i>the Star</i>!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When, on the brooding darkness of the void<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the world swung like a tiny star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death hovered with his sable wings outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hell yawned far below, God gave to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His promise of redemption through the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dripped from pierced hands high on Calvary&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mortal death of God's immortal Son.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Empires have vanished, kings have laid them down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence, but the word of Him remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cried in agony upon the tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Forgive them, for they know not what they do."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the fresh-hewn cross lifts to the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In consecrated Oberammergau;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more I see the Christ in humble guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teaching the multitudes, and hear his voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In supplication and in parable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaim his mission to a sinful world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, could the world but gaze upon that Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heart attuned unto the symboled love<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The kiss of Judas burns from lips to brow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of scorners, and the poisoned crown of thorns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Greed has woven for humanity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bites like the chaplet that the Saviour wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day that He was crowned and crucified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I see around the shining cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phantoms that shudder when the name of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is whispered by the multitude; I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grim Avarice with shriveled fingers clutch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden bauble; shrinking by his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppression stands and hugs a clanking chain,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span class="i0">While deeper in the gloom, with eyes aglow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And matted hair still dripping red with gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits War, her trembling hand enclasped within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spectral hand of Death. O Christus, thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom it has been given once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To symbolize the passion of the cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach thy task with heart inspired by love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Saviour's words fall from thy lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thine the Saviour's exaltation when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told the dying thief upon the cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should be with Him in Paradise.<br /></span>
